Excellent product. Pretty competitive with price however you were not the cheapest.,1
A+++ great products,1
snelle levering. prima product.,1
I ordered a Phone Cover and it was delivered the very next morning can't get better service than that. Well done and thank you.,1
Good bargain,1
I got my first order last week and enjoyed the leggings. They were super comfy and fit great and are my new favorite pants to workout in.,1
Goed programme,1
I was able to fill my position in a great timely manner with a highly qualified candidate!,1
Thank you for my lovely sheepskin boots.,1
So handy if there is any problem so easy to return. Would highly recommend,1
Easy better value than bigger names and hassle free.,1
Super fast delivery. Easy payment. Item description very accurate. Thank you!,1
Decided to take a chance on this rental despite the fact that it was soooo much cheaper than so many other rental car companies. But couldnt have gone smoother. Quick and easy pickup and drop off of car. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. No high pressure tactics to buy into their offered rental insurance (I have my own thru my credit card company). No hassle re amount of gas in tank when returned - simply left it at same level as when taken out - no additional charges (I had read many reviews about how some rental companies gouge you for the gas tank fill up upon return). Took the auto toll payment feature as didnt want to think about it when on the toll roads - apparently you cannot pay these at the toll booth itself. Great experience all around. Great value - paid $65 CAD for 2 weeks! Unlimited mileage. Crazy!,1
Excellent booking process. I hope the ground staff follow through...,1
What a Brilliant idea ! Great communicationWell done homestay ! First time using it found accommodation after sifting through a few & found one I liked the look of the most regards location accommodationprice.,1
"Think it's safer to have a ""go between"" although it is up to your own gut instinct in the end which is why I rated a 4. As you've no idea about who your staying with Really !",1
Don't know if younger single or more vulnerable people could do with factual info from people who actually know the host ? I made it my business to look for the host on other sites & found them on trip advisor which was a great comfort to read reviews from others & put me much more at ease.,1
The host has already arranged transport for us from the airport & also for when we continue on to another part of Cuba at a fraction of the cost of our travel agent ! Thanks very much Homestay !,1
Max was very helpful and patient,1
Authentic battery and super fast delivery,1
The whole experience was very positive.,1
I had a very pleasant experience from Lenskart. Recently I purchased an eye wear and it beats my expectation - quality delivery service etc. Kudos team!!,1
I recommend Lenskart.,1
Excellent prices for the hotel we preferred. User friendly booking form. All round good experience. Would definitely use again!,1
Their selection of frames mats other accessories is an inexpensive but tasteful way to compliment artwork,1
I recently purchased 3 frames for an original collage of mine and 2 small acrylics of another artist all will look great in my new bathroom,1
Tevreden over Eset. Set-it-and-forget-it lage systeem-belasting.,1
Their outfits are adorable and durable. Their website is wonderful to navigate.,1

They are really providing a bang for you buck with grate products grate prices and excellent customer service.,1
I purchased two frames for art work for my bathroom a number of years ago from American Frame and recently acquired another work I wanted to add. Was happy to find that American Frame still carries the same frame and color that is an exact match.,1
This was an excellent service from start to finish without any hassle.,1
I would recommend it.,1
Great service. Technician was very polite and very quick at fitting 4 new tyers.,1
Very happy with the service. Would recommend to anyone.,1
An excellent service. Friendly and efficient. I wouldn't hesitate to use it again.,1

Ben was very polite and got straight on with the job of renewing all the valves on my tyres. No fuss or any problems. Would recommend the company without hesitation.,1
Dan did a great job fitting four new tyres to my car. I'll definitely use this service again when I next need new tyres.,1
Fast efficient service at a very good price!,1
Hurtig levering. Ellers ingen erfaring,1
I've booked many times on flighthub.com and never had a problem,1
Received a great service. The technician was polite and explained what he would be doing and changed over my tyre in a very efficient manner. Would recomend this service and certainly use again should I need a replacement tyre.,1
Buying tyres is not fun but you made it as easy and painless and cost effective as it could possibly be. The service was brilliant - and I did not leave the comfort of my own home. I will use you again.,1
Great product and great service. Fast efficient and good sale offers too,1
I was contacted by Christina Clark regarding the two front tyres Vales needed investigating  she booked an senior manerger to come today to solves the matter ! . When he cames he changed the new Vale and rebalance the wheel straight away. Iam very impressed of responding !! Good work,1
Good quick delivery good quality products. Needed to be sent with instructions for the attaching the bike rack,1
I'm a first time customer. Needed a new hard drive for my HP laptop. Found DriveSolutions online and had a seamless transaction from start to finish. Very pleased with the service and communication. I would buy here again.,1
Got a fantastic offer on rental for our vacation. Booking was quick and easy !!,1
Thank you.,1
My fiancé and I used Homestay.com to find a place to live over in Dublin for about 2 months. The website was easy to navigate and provided an adequate amount of filters to help us find the perfect home to stay in! I would highly recommend this service to anyone wanting to travel abroad who want to integrate themselves with the locals! Easy way to talk to potential hosts negotiate accommodations and confidently view the home you will be staying in!,1
Properties were displayed with adequate information to assist decision making. The response time on availability was excellent and we are looking forward to our 'home away from home'.,1
Thanks Homestay!,1
I stayed with Sandy in Parkwood Qld for 12 nights it was amazing.,1

The correct product was dispatched immediately payment received and arrived by express post next day.,1
I am very happy with the service provided.,1
Item was in stock and given to me very quickly. Staff were friendly and polite. No problems at all.,1
When shopping online is all about the only idea comes up with my mind is Panda Cash Back. This is the most trusted online shopping I know and a recommended shopping service. It will guarantee you to pay off in instant.,1
Great range of products. You are kept up to date with your order and given plenty of notice when delivery is due.,1
Van bestelling tot levering  perfect !,1
Quick and clean like a well oiled machine!,1
Scelta facilita e costi trasparenti.,1
I worked with Les Garrett on 01/31 who was able to work with me to develop interview questions to help locate better candidates for my job postings. He was very knowledgeable on the subject matter and took the added step of sending my some tutorial links to help me better manage my account. Invaluable customer service!,1
Used Sixt as the best company by far - the other rental 'main companies were extremely busy on a Saturday with skiers - Sixt were brilliant easy to deal with and very efficient. Polite and happy to help - even in English.,1
Great service & very active in speed of reply to make buying off them a pleasure.,1
I really like tomtop.,1
I got all the needed information and the reservation was ok.,1
I used to do a lot of business with American Frame when I was more into photography matting and framing my images and selling them. But lo my focus has changed and I had not done any of that kind of work for at least a few years. However I recently needed some frames and immediately went to American Frame and was entirely impressed with the on-line interactive ordering process and delivery. I have not yet opened the package but I trust the materials are as good as ever. I would hope though that American Frame was not so often out of stock for standard walnut frames. :(,1
een super virus canner,1
the mechanic shop not great but services good and onus,1
clear on what you are getting.,1
I could not book key pick up and include a child seat.,1
First time buyer great service fast and very professional. Great customer service no question goes unanswered. I look forward to using their services again.,1

It was very easy to find items I needed. Package arrived on time and was very well packed. Software and SSD I ordered worked perfectly.,1
Excellent hotel location good room service Q: At times there is some noise from outside .aoli If you replace this dual pane windows Iftnr the problem.,1
We are a small company but got great service and feedback from Winhost.,1
Prima begeleiding via de chat.,1
Great Customer service talked with them on Skype all the way through. They were very reassuring and did exactly what was promised. Cant really ask for more. If you're planning on a service like this I would highly recommend them.,1
I bought 12 wood frames that arrived faster than promised and were better than I expected (or feared) for their pretty low price. In other words corners matched no gaps no dings paint looked good.,1
Reliable quick service.,1

I ordered framing hardware and it arrived as expected. No surprises which I appreciate.,1
Easy to use website Thank you!,1
Great service from initial phone call right to the front door fitter looked the part and got on with the job without fuss he was courteous throuout I will be recommending to friends and family and will definitely use again. Cheers,1
All round top quality service at extremely competitive price,1
When you have an operator who is difficult to understand ask for another,0
When I needed them they didn't help took both car and home insurance out close them both and gone with a more reliable company now.,0
Why is My order is always feg ?,0
"WHAT KIND OF FUC.KED UP COMPANY IS THIS ??? I BOOKED 2 RETURN TICKETS AND GOT A MESSAGE WITH THE TEXT ""PACK YOUR BACK....ECT"". THE NEXT DAY I GOT A MAIL WHERE THEY CANCELLED MY TICKETS. ONE HOUR LATER I GOT A NEW MAIL WITH THE TEXT ""YOUR ENQUIRY HAS BEEN PASSED ON. WE RETURN WITHIN 72 HOURS"" I NEVER HEARD ANYTHING FROM THE COMPANY. NOW I BOUGTH NEW TICKETS WITH ANOTHER COMPANY BUT HAD TO PAY ABOUT 70 DOLLAR MORE BECAUSE THE PRICE HAS GONE UP. I CAN NOT SAY THIS LOUD ENOUGH: DONT USE THIS FUC.KED UP COMPANY . AND BRAVOFLY IF YOU READ THIS THEN MARK MY WORDS: GO TO HELL YOU FUC.KING RETARTED IDIOTS I WILL SPREAD THIS STORY IN EVERY ONLINE MEDIA I HAVE ACCESS TO",0
I ordered what I thought was a pair of blue jeans and a shirt. It took months to arrive (which I expected as I checked other people's reviews). When I finally received my items the 'jeans' were actually a pair of cheaply made tights with picturesome of pockets instead of real ones. Even the 'fly' was just a insure on the tights to try to look like a button and zipper. The shirt was also very thin flimsy material. Very cheaply made. Not to mention the sizing is for only very petite women. Most of it says one size fits all (maybe if by all you mean all children). I would NEVER order anything from here again. Very disappointing since the clothing in the pictures looks so nice!,0
Of the first 3 opened only 1 even plays!,0
Bravofly is terrible. Never book with them. I have been waiting for a refund and a voucher code that functions for 1.5 YEARS. This company has tereibel customer service and does not follow through with its promises. I call them and they always tell me I'll be contacted within 48 hours which now I understand to mean NEVER. I have asked to speak to someone higher in the chain of command and customer service reps just tell me they can't transfer me. This is crap and I am LIVID. They owe me a voucher and $4000 I had to spend on tickets I had already paid for. Get it together BravoFly. YOU SUCK!,0
I have bought what I thought to be last minute tickets flying to Australia from Edinburgh.,0
2 weeks later after getting boking confirmation they noticed me of cancelling the whole ticket because of an error made by them !,0
Even though they tell to refund the ticket price ( I haven't recieved any money back yet) I have paid additional total of more than 300e for connection flights and hotel. I tried to write them about it but they have basically no email for customer support! I tried to reply on the email I recieved but got no reply. I wrote them on Facebook as the only way to reach them but got just some autogenerated text of getting to me later.,0
I either wanted them to honor my flight as I bought it or participate on my expenses caused by their error but no communication is possible with them at all.,0
Stay away and beware !,0
I was really impressed with the prices I found so I decided to purchase from here. But working with the website has been a nightmare. Everything was easy to find and navigate but there were just so many issues with page errors and loading issues.,0
I would never recommend anyone. Zero value for your money and time.,0
No I wouldn't use your service nor would every refer anyone you simply don't keep promises. I was given so many false promises regarding the transfer I would have appreciated if I were given a right information. Even though the processing was delayed I would have been happy to have realistic and honest response. However 7 times from 7 different people I was given false statements and different delivery dates! Which in itself shows the flaw and dishonesty to client's time and shows zero respect to client's trust.,0
I will never buy here again. Can't reach customer service. Can't cancel order as per Company terms notified via e-mail. Can't find country of origin. I purchased a Trump hat and realized immediately the country of origin was not listed I tried to contact someone to no avail. I e-mailed to state I did not want a Make America Great Again hat if not made in USA. I later received an e-mail stating no cancellation as per terms and stating it was not USA made.,0
I received countless errors when trying to order my merchandise online. Made it very inconvenient.,0
5 years ago I paid for 5 Orders and never received them... I used to buy from Brazil and suddenly Oldies stopped to ship for Brazil... I never had my money refunded... I lost US$ 60000.,0
Nowadays I by the CDS and ship to USA... A firm called Shipito.com receives everything and send me here to Brazil...,0
At the end of the year I bought the new Metallica CD(The 3CD Version). Oldies send me the wrong Version(2CD). I contacted the Customer Service and they told me they not gonna send me the right CD...,0
I am just writting this to say that Oldies lost a custommer that has 50.000 itens in his collection... Oldies no more!!!!,0
Monthy call to india plan price is high,0
They are terrible and will take your money. Don't use HOTELONE. they give terrible customer service. When called them about my refund for my cancellation they didn't refund me my money and customer service rep hung up on me and I had to call back again.,0
Just made a booking with Goldcar I have used them before on several occasions and have been satisfied.,0
However on this occasion I logged on and selected to redeem my reward points and received an acknowledgement stating they would be credited against my next booking which I duly made. However at checkout there was no mention of the rewards points being applied and sure enough they are still showing in my account.,0
There was also a promotion code that I copied and pasted only to receive a message stating that the code was invalid!,0
Needs to be sorted out.,0
I will never use gold car again. I was rented a car find a lot of scratches so i got to the office and got the guy with me to take pictures of all the scratches on the car with he's ipad thing. Now after i have delivered the car i just got a mail with a charge of 392€ for the old scratches the guy was out taking pictures off. Thats bad customer service! I will never use gold car again..,0
I did not receive the product I ordered from eVitamins. Unfortunately the eVitamins customer service representative was unable and/or unwilling to understand the reality of postal delivery in our Mountain area (spoke to her twice in the past week of so). I also believe that I am due a refund on my order + shipping ($21.14) as it has not and will not ever be delivered.,0
the staff do not want to work in liffey valley in dublin when i ask for my size they wont look for this shoe!!! please have a word with shop manger. thank you MAIREAD HARKIN.,0
More than one week but I couldn't receive my order meanwhile it said that only 3-5 days. A bit disappointed with delivery service and it costed me nearly 10euro.,0
"i recently had a package lost at a purolator depot. very frusterationg experience. very little customer care support. it was a long process. finally got it figured out replacement delivery is now delayed ""in transit"" again for a week. DO NOT USE PUROLATOR. THEY ARE HORRIBLE",0
Arrived at the car rental 1 our before scheduled time because off the time difference. I've forgot that when I signed the lease at home. The manager at goldcar at told me that the car was not in but he got a larger car. With a higher price. We waited an hour an got our car (cold) and totally scratched and dirty. At goldcars area there where at least 10 cars same model. All of them cold not been out for a spin.,0
Great customer service Goldcar.,0
Next time I will pay overprice to avoid Goldcar.,0
I ordered once on Dec 19 2016 and then on Jan 12 2017. I have not received either order. I have lost money on both the orders for no fault of mine and my undue belief on eVitamins.com.,0
I have been contacting them thru email but they have not done anything from their end.,0
"I try to call on phone and I always get a recording saying"" No rep is available"" I never get such non-response form other E-Commerce like Amazon. They have reps always available and they call back immediately when I ask them to call.",0
This is a shame that such a nonresponsive E-commerce company is allowed to operate their business.,0
It is amazing that eVitamins.com replied to the review in TrustPilot in 10 hrs itelf while my emails to eVitamins are till pending for few days.,0
What a facade!,0
Such E-Commerce companies do not belong in the marketplace who do not want to:,0
1. Provide enough reps to answer phonecalls,0
2. Do not want to address concerns of the customers but just give wishy washy answers,0
3. Do not reply to customers enquiries for days but have time to respond to survey on TrustPilot immediately,0
4. When Delivery is not made they wash their hands off.,0
Customers who got their products should feel very lucky but others who do not get it should not expect any co-operation from eVitamins.com by writing or by phone calls.,0
Booked online for a price then paid more than double at the desk. A part the insurance was not in the contract still paid way more.,0
BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY i ordered a dress for my senior prom. It came in and as soon as i tried it on the beads on it were falling off all over the floor AND it's so see through. Hate it,0
I had a problem checking out so I called support. Support was not willing to help me with my issue and my call was hung up on.,0
Better companies out there who aren't out to scam you. Avoid.,0
I was a returning customer because I got my living room furniture and my bed set from here. So when it was time to get my daughters upgrade I thought of them however her grandparents had gotten her a bed. I'm still waiting for my refund. This was in December and it's February hence 2 months after! Not to mention the workers were smoking Marijuana in the garage when I came to talk to someone about my return. Shop at own risk people.,0
My first order was placed on 2016-11-19 for a camera to be shipped from the German warehouse. According to the description the camera was on stock and usually would will be shipped in24hours. On 2016-11-28 the camera still hadn't been shipped and I canceled the order. I than ordered from Amazon and received the camera in 3 days and at the same price.,0
"My second order was placed on 2016-11-27 for a Wifi IP camera. On 2017-01-12 (7 weeks later) I had still not received the camera and the tracking link only showed ""Shipment information received"". I wrote to customer service twice but never got any reply so I finally had to open a Paypal item not received claim.",0
All the time they kept sending me daily advertising e-mails from which I tried to unsubscribe using the unsubscribe link and although I got a message that I was unsubscribed I still received the mails. Writing to customer support asking to stop sending them did not help either so I had to block tomtop all together.,0
My advise.... spend your money elsewhere.,0
I could not recharge today when I needed most',0
I don't like the fact I have to pay the return shipping on the item I purchased,0
Booking was straightforward however I did take collision damage waver not realising it was a per day rate but that's my fault,0
However when email booking came through it has pick up from 10am and drop off 10am I had given flight details arriving 1-2pm and leaving 5-6 pm have tried 4 times to get through on phone only to be left on hold for 20/30 mins have a feeling I'm going to get hit for another days hire for extra hours this is why I'm not satisfied,0
I got my name with a medical symbol the caduceus engraved. You pay an additional 10$ for this and the symbol came out horrible. You can't even see what it is. I would have sent it back but they don't allow you to if it was engraved which is ridiculous if the engraving came out with poor quality. You cannot even tell what it is. I should have went with something more solid like a star. It says my first name caduceus then last name. The symbol just looks like a random engravement. To pay close to 200$ for something just to find the engravement to come out so poorly maybe I should have purchased from one of the more expensive web sites. The stethoscope itself is fine but again I spent this much in a stethoscope because I plan to have it for years now with very poor engraving. And also know what you want before hand. They do not let you return engraved items. So this stethoscope works great but it is extremely heavy and bothers my neck so be mindful.,0
Had nothing but issues with hosting and support,0
Tickets were way over priced for their location! I would not use this service again and definitely not recommend 'Ticketmaster Resale' - What a resale rip off!,0
The headphones worked but the hookup from the TV did not work on either of our TV sets. I am returning this device.,0
The warm lavender slippers are marvelous!,0
The website has a large selection of glasses which is what the company gets one point for. The entire handling proces is a disaster which I can only summarise as the worst shopping experience ever. I will not go back. I will inform my friends and familiy not to order with this company.,0
"We payed 50% extra at the rentaloffice because of hidden fees. AirPortrentals were hidding the extra fees and did not show them in the ""detailed"" price description.",0
The policy document led me to believe I was covered for a compensation if there was a piste closure while on a snow holiday. This in fact in the small print is only redeemable against the cost of travelling to another resort to ski.,0
This insurance proved worthless for us as every ski resort in the area had closed and this was impossible.,0
I have used Multitrip numerous times before but as this was my first time trying to make a claim and realising how misleading the policy is I will not be using them again.,0
I booked the flight from Perth Australia to Bangkok in Thailand on 21th January at7pm. I arrived at the airport and the staff said there was no my name for passengers list. I got a confirmation E mail but the staff said I needed itinerary and they said your booking was on 22d at 7pm. I checked the travel detail through my account on Rumbo website and it was 21th. I had to fry on 21th so paid ＄210 extra to change the date and afterwards sent E mail 3 times to rumbo but Unfortunately I haven't got any replying. I called to them at the airport aswell but it was out of working hours.... I don't know what to do now but I shoud get money back otherwise It is clearly that I never want to use Rombo anymore,0
After I placed my order I believe on Dec 29th I broke my ankle and didn't check my emails for about 3 days. When I did check discovered my order had been canceled. (No one seems to know why). I replaced the order VIA phone and was promised shipment by UPS on Monday the 9th. Didn't receive the shipment until Friday the 13th by regular mail and not UPS,0
Delivery was longer than a month way too slow. I was not even notified about the delay I needed to make an inquiry and ask what is going on to be informed about the delay. That is not satisfactory of an online retailer.,0
The 2 wicker shelves I purchased each over $30 were not of good quality and certainly not worth $30 something! If I had paid $15 for each of those shelves then that would have been better than paying over $60 not including shipping either. The corner shelves the 2 top shelf hinges are not long enough to keep them down and the bottom shelf is missing the hinge all together! I fixed these myself because I wasn't going to throw away any more money by returning these items. The canvas tote on wheels was nice but it took too long to arrive. I placed my order 12/28/16 and the shelves arrived 1/10/17 and the tote on 1/11/17.,0
I have never ordered from a company and have it take almost 1 month to find out that it is now in transit. I still have yet to receive itso I am just assuming it will come. But this is a very slow company so if you don't mind waiting then it will be fine.,0
The got some info entered wrong I signed up days in advance and it cause my power to be cut off your fault not mine. I tried to get the power back on they said it would take 24 hours I got another company to do it in 4 hours sad when you let someone go who would have paid you money every month for the next who knows how many years,0
I felt like a number not a customer,0
Please feel free to contact me,0

"I sent you an email several days ago in regard to the condition of the items I ordered. The summary of the Email: ""6 boxes of band aids shipped in a plastic bag. The boxes were mashed so much they were scattered/mixed in the bag. Not a very smart way to ship these items. "". I have not received a reply back. Don't think I will order from you again if this is the way you treat your customers.",0
I purchased 8 boxes of contacts I should have done better research your company was not the cheapest. I spent over $400. I found them much cheaper at lens.com. I called your company to inquire if you price match she initially said yes but when I told her how much they were she instantly said no. She offered a $10 credit. I could have saved almost $200 by going with lens.com going forward I will be purchasing my contacts elsewhere. Your representative was rude I spent over $400 I can get better customer service somewhere else. Because of this situation you have lost a loyal customer.,0
They have a good prices but when they cancel my flight it took 4 phone calls with total 4 hours on the phone with no satisfactory at the endI decided for full refund-what caused me a lot of problemsand they told me,0
That It is going to take 6-8 weeks to get my money back??What a service.2 times they told me that they going to call me within 24 to 48 hours - nothing happend-no respond.,0
That is my experience-still waiting for my full refund,0
Have a nice day,0
I've been using this service many time but the 1st time i need to claim for something they are showing who they are: a low cost assurance with poor customer care. This is supposed to be for backpackers but it's not at all..,0
"My headset had audio problems so I decided to call support to get a repair done. First guy was one of the nicest and informational customer support out there. I got my headphones BUT when I sent them I guess he forgot to tell me not to put the cable in (which I put it in incase it was the cord that caused the sound not to work) so when the repaired headset I was missing the audio cable so now I had to do the process over again. This time I was connected to a man that was very irritated and just made it a lot harder to get my aux cable back very rude not actually trying to help me kind of ""just trying to do his job and go home.""",0
I called 2 times because I didn't know my dress size for a particular dress on the website and the lady I talked to told me I'm exactly a size 12 both times I called. I'm normally a size four or six and she insisted that I get a twelve and I did exactly what she said. I tried on the dress and it was extremely large. Not to mention it was expensive and it had been picked on the inside of the bust and there were stains on it. The lady was going to charge me a restocking fee to send it back however we worked it out and in the end she said she would refund the money and send me a return label so I wouldn't have to pay the extra fees. Overall the size chart is not correctly proportioned so if your going to order a dress from prom girl order your normal size.,0
I did my transactions more than 15 days ago  still did not received money in my India bank account. And still paying 10% APR  on the amount  since I needed that money urgently in India,0

This was a bad experience,0
Ive waited for my contacts for a while n when they arrived they were left outside for the whole day and they froze!!! I'm not happy about that. I wish they required signature because I work till late night and I'm not home the whole day. Ive had a bad experience and don't know if I will order from this website again,0
I paid $10 for a $20 discount code plus a $10 coupon.When I placed the order the coupon could not be applied. I contacted the customer service department on the next business day and they told me the coupon had expired and couldn't be applied.,0
My order was not delivered in the 2 days promised by you and paid for by me. My mother did not get her Christmas present on time. Poor customer service.,0
Awful experience Held my money for 2 weeks Hostage EMAILED ME 68 times for no reason to call your number and you call it and there isnt anyone there to PICK UP took me 2 weeks to get a hold of someone.. Pathetic,0
I went on a shopping spree spending a few hundred (and then some) on DHGate only to receive counterfeit items. When i brought this up to customer service for each individual order they told me that the products were not counterfeit and they couldn't see the comparison between what I received and what was described. The font's of the labels are different the packaging is off and the products themselves were faulty and not quite right. Everything is unsellable for my business. DHGate refuses to right the wrongs and keeps siding with the manufacturers on certain products. I've lost a lot of money and precious time dealing with this company. If something seems too good to be true guess what it usually is and thats what you'll get with DHGate.,0

Be warned and record conversations! I booked a compact automatic car for a month but was disappointed to receive a semi automatic cumbersome Fiat 500 ( dreadful car to drive) they said no other car was available at the time so I had to take it. After the drive to our destination I found the car to be difficult and in my eyes dangerous to drive as in a parked position it would roll forward downhill in REVERSE gear before enough acceleration was applied to move in the right direction i.e. Backwards and then it would lurch backwards in an uncontrollable manner. On ringing Centauro Malaga to complain I was told that Yes it was a difficult car to drive but in order to exchange it I had to return it to the office myself. Because of the difficulty and perceived danger I didn't want to drive the car again. Eventually they agreed to bring a different car out to me but NEVER mentioned a Fee. It wasn't until I returned home that I found 124 euros had been taken from my credit card without my permission. The company can only say I should have read the small print. I WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN and warn others to be careful.,0
Hi there,0
Thank you first of all for reminders for the new policy. That helps.,0
what I don't understand is why wasn't possible to be contacted by any of customer service to help me to updated my details and instead of this I am requested to contact myself. I think a little service to someone who didn't stopped you to renew a contract without any problem can be done.,0
Best regards,0
Items never arrived and I asked for a refund they responded to offering me one because my orders got lost in the mail they said I said yes and they haven't responded back and I have no refund .,0
